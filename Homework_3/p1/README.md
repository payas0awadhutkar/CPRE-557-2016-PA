## Assignment 3 : Light and Material

This assignment required to create 4 spheres to simulate different light sources and different materials.

This folder contains following files
 - hw3.png : A screenshot of the virtual scene with 4 spheres
 - hw3.cpp : Main file of the code. Contains function to draw and render spheres.
 - mysphere.cpp : A custom sphere implementation derived from GLSphere.cpp provided by instructor Dr. Radkowski
 - mysphere.h : Header file for mysphere
 - vshader.vs : Vertex shader, derived from example shader provided
 - fshader.fs : Fragment shader, derived from example shader provided

The code heavily depends on various example codes provided by instructor - GLSphere, GLAppearance especially. If one needs to compile this and execute, he must copy all necessary files from gl_common folder. (Not providing them as instructor has access to all those files) Code has explanatory comments to understand it.
