### Assignment 4 Problem 1

This problem was about being able to load image and texture. The sample code provided to us was sufficient to do this and only completing TODO part was the objective. I used grand canyon image (grand_canyon.bmp). I faced some technical issues as opengl on Linux is not as smoothe as other systems so the result image may have looked better on other machines (Windows/MAC). Result screenshot is the result of the final effort among many efforts.
