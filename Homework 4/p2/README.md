### Assignment 4 Problem 2

In this problem goal was to blend 3 images - animal, gradient and landscape into each other. As there are lots of ways to do this I tried a few combinations and am submitting them.

I created a custom class CustomTexture to allow three textures at once. Going through the discussion board on blackboard I later realized that it was not necessary to do so. But as this allowed greater flexibility I went with this approach.

Images used :

1. image1.bmp - Image of a lion (animal)
2. image2.bmp - A color gradient
3. image3.bmp - Image of a tree (landscape)

Combinations tried :

1. blend1.png - This is result of simple addition of three textures
2. blend2.png - Result of multiplication. Generated a much darker image
3. blend3.png - Use different color channels of different image. i.e. Red channel of first, Green Channel of second and Blue of the third.

Inspiration for blend3 came from here - http://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-OpenGL/Blending
